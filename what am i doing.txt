Step -1 
A socket is an endpoint that you can name and address in a network.
Socket programming shows how to use socket APIs to establish communication links between
remote and local processes.
The processes that use a socket can reside on the same system or different network,
Sockets allow you to exchange information between processes on the same machine or across a network

server processes - 

1) socket(domain,type,protocol) - used to activate the endpoint (machine or node).
domain: if ipv4 network being used or v6
type : datagram or stream (tcp or udp)
protocol : IP case it is 0

we first initialize the endpoint. (telephone leke aoo dono end se)

2)bind - address associate (telephone number denge) socket number is a combination of ip and port

3)Listen - passive mode me waiting for a client (phone call). important thing here is backlog. which is a queue
which accumulates messages

4) accept - from queue we will accept the request and communication is established.


client side we have
1) socket
2) connect - in connect we connects the socket referred socket address is provided.




Step - 2
Sometimes the size of our message could be more that the size of our buffer.
